Furthermore, Ellacuria himself on several occasions expressed opinions which did not concur with those of the fmln.  However, he felt that a solution to the salvadoran problem could not exclude the people's inclusion of the fmln.  The assassins who acted under the protection of the curfew are from the salvadoran army, they are not unidentified terrorists, like the ap cable says.  They are assassins of the salvadoran army, the same army which has all the support of the U.S.  government.  In this, we can also see the double standard of the bush administration. On the one hand, all its publicity apparatus says to the world that Washington is in favor of democracy and respect for human rights. However, in practice, it supports the assassins of priests and supplies bombs and rockets so that the salvadoran army -- which has planes and helicopters provided by the United States -- can bomb the salvadoran civilian population.",

How could I welcome in Nicaragua the representative of a government that kills priests and bishops, that killed Monsignor Romero; a government that kills clergymen, that has killed nuns and members of other churches, catholics and evangelists; a government that kills workers, peasants, laborers, and leaders of political parties, that has killed more than 600 Christian democratic party leaders.  They were killed by Arena [Nationalist republic alliance], the ruling party in El Salvador, and the salvadoran army, which is the same thing.  I kept asking myself: how can I welcome them in Nicaragua?  it would be like welcoming somoza.  All I could come up with was to find an excuse not to hold the meeting.  It would have been terrible for the nicaraguan people to have to welcome and have as a guest the representative of a government that kills priests, nuns, workers, laborers, peasants, intellectuals, professionals, and workers.

On 2 November, the guerrillas issued a statement strongly condemning the terrorist activity of the squad and declaring the cancellation of the third round of talks with the government scheduled in Venezuela.  On the same night the guerrillas launched a large-scale offensive \"to eliminate fascism.\"  About 8,000 guerrillas swiftly captured many towns and strategic positions northwest of the capital and cut key communications lines between the capital and the hinterland.  In the meantime, they also attacked some 50 government army bases and police stations in the hinterland, thus controlling 30 percent of the country's territory.  They have established \"local people's governments\" in 8 of the 14 provinces throughout the country.  During this period, the government dispatched armored cars and air force units to carry out counterattacks.  They wantonly bombarded the residential areas near the capital city occupied by the guerrillas.  After 8 days of fierce battle, the guerrillas shot down 12 government fighter planes and helicopters; destroyed 34 tanks, armored cars, and patrol cars; and captured a large amount of arms and ammunition.  Subsequently battles continued in regions outside the capital city.  Since early December both sides have engaged in fierce battles in the capital city and the hinterland. The guerrillas used mortars to attack the building of the government army general staff headquarters, the U.S.  embassy, and the presidential restaurant, whereas the government army dispatched planes to bombard the guerrilla positions.  Fierce battles have also broken out in Chalatenango, San Miguel, and other towns, thereby causing heavy casualties and property losses.",

During this 10-year-long war, 70,000 people have died and the national economy has been seriously destroyed.  The ultrarightist nationalist republican alliance [Arena] Won the general election early this year, thus aggravating the conflict between the guerrillas and the government.  Prior to the election, the guerrillas put forward a peace proposal demanding six months' posponement of the election so as to make their participation possible.  But this proposal was rejected by the government.  Because almost half of the voters did not vote, the guerrillas declared it did not recognize the Cristiani government. Pressed by domestic public opinion and urged by the Central american peace agreement, the government and the guerrillas held two rounds of talks in September and October.  During their talks the guerrillas demanded that the government stop its suppression, introduce political, economic, and judicial reforms, reorganize the armed forces, and punish the \"dare-to-die squad.\"  The government insisted that the guerrillas should lay down their arms before reforms were carried out.  The hard-line position of the government reflected the established policy of the ruling party, which has all along stood for ruling the country by military means, advocated the suppression of democratic forces, and supported the \"dare-to-die squad\" in carrying out assassination.  A university president in Central America was assassinated by the squad for criticizing the ultrarightist policy of the ruling party.  Recently the ruling party supported the \"dare-to-die squad\" in attacking the labor federation's building. This ignited the current civil war and undermined the peace process in the country. The guerrillas issued a statement on 12 December condemning the meeting of the five heads of state for being partial to the ultrarightist salvadorian government.  They made it clear that they would not accept any effort to dissolve the guerrilla forces and would carry on their struggle.  [Continued]",

With the due respect that the presidential commission deserves, the supreme court of justice should be consulted about what should be done next because the case is under the purview of guatemalan courts, especially those in Jutiapa jurisdiction.  Those courts should be the ones tasked with collecting the evidence, issuing the summons, and making the necessary statements.  Anything else constitutes interfering with justice.

      "sentence": " The current civil war in El Salvador was triggered off by the destruction of the headquarters of the labor federation, the country's biggest trade union organization.  On 31 October, an ultrarightist \"dare-to-die squad\" supported by the government and the military used a heavy bomb to bombard the headquarters building of the labor federation, killing and wounding over 40 people including principal leaders of the federation.  On 2 November, the guerrillas issued a statement strongly condemning the terrorist activity of the squad and declaring the cancellation of the third round of talks with the government scheduled in Venezuela.  On the same night the guerrillas launched a large-scale offensive \"to eliminate fascism.\"  About 8,000 guerrillas swiftly captured many towns and strategic positions northwest of the capital and cut key communications lines between the capital and the hinterland.  In the meantime, they also attacked some 50 government army bases and police stations in the hinterland, thus controlling 30 percent of the country's territory.  They have established \"local people's governments\" in 8 of the 14 provinces throughout the country.  During this period, the government dispatched armored cars and air force units to carry out counterattacks.  They wantonly bombarded the residential areas near the capital city occupied by the guerrillas.  After 8 days of fierce battle, the guerrillas shot down 12 government fighter planes and helicopters; destroyed 34 tanks, armored cars, and patrol cars; and captured a large amount of arms and ammunition.  Subsequently battles continued in regions outside the capital city.  Since early December both sides have engaged in fierce battles in the capital city and the hinterland. The guerrillas used mortars to attack the building of the government army general staff headquarters, the U.S.  embassy, and the presidential restaurant, whereas the government army dispatched planes to bombard the guerrilla positions.  Fierce battles have also broken out in Chalatenango, San Miguel, and other towns, thereby causing heavy casualties and property losses.",

The armed forces of a country should respond to the democratic process and to the government that is legitimately elected by the people.  And therefore, this would curtail the freedom of choice of the nicaraguan people in trying to control and govern the country, even though it is not from the position of being president of the country.  Secondly, I think that I have mentioned before that it is not the result of the election that will change our attitude with respect to our diplomatic relations with Nicaragua, but rather the attitude of the nicaraguan government with respect to aid to the fmln, to the marxist guerrillas in El Salvador. And in this case we still have not seen that change taking place. Obviously, we feel that with mrs Chamorro as president of Nicaragua that this aid will stop and therefore make it easier for the resumption of normal relations between El Salvador and Nicaragua, but it is that attitude that would make a change and not necessarily the result in itself.",

The surrendering of weapons in the hands of this group will be discussed at this meeting.  The four-day meeting began on 18 May at the Guayas electoral tribunal.  However, the meeting was continued later at an undisclosed location in Guayaquil.  During their sessions, in addition to making a decision on the surrendering of weapons, avc leaders will also assess the agreement they signed a year ago with the president Rodrigo borja government.  The accord made it possible for them to cease the armed struggle in exchange for a government dialogue with social sectors in the country.  Prior to the beginning of the fourth avc national conference, avc leader Santiago dillman reported on 18 May that the final decision on the surrendering of weapons was a logical step -- after taking into consideration that the armed struggle in Ecuador and in the rest of Latin America is no longer the proper course.  Therefore, he announced, this alfarist meeting will also analyze the decision to organize a new political party or to allow avc leaders to join an already existing group recognized by the supreme electoral tribunal.",
