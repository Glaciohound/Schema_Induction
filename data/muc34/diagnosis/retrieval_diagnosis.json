Their tactic was to make us waste ammunition.  They were not really trying to make us abandon our positions yet.",

How could I welcome in Nicaragua the representative of a government that kills priests and bishops, that killed Monsignor Romero; a government that kills clergymen, that has killed nuns and members of other churches, catholics and evangelists; a government that kills workers, peasants, laborers, and leaders of political parties, that has killed more than 600 Christian democratic party leaders.  They were killed by Arena [Nationalist republic alliance], the ruling party in El Salvador, and the salvadoran army, which is the same thing.  I kept asking myself: how can I welcome them in Nicaragua?  it would be like welcoming somoza.  All I could come up with was to find an excuse not to hold the meeting.  It would have been terrible for the nicaraguan people to have to welcome and have as a guest the representative of a government that kills priests, nuns, workers, laborers, peasants, intellectuals, professionals, and workers.

        " The current civil war in El Salvador was triggered off by the destruction of the headquarters of the labor federation, the country's biggest trade union organization.  On 31 October, an ultrarightist \"dare-to-die squad\" supported by the government and the military used a heavy bomb to bombard the headquarters building of the labor federation, killing and wounding over 40 people including principal leaders of the federation.  On 2 November, the guerrillas issued a statement strongly condemning the terrorist activity of the squad and declaring the cancellation of the third round of talks with the government scheduled in Venezuela.  On the same night the guerrillas launched a large-scale offensive \"to eliminate fascism.\"  About 8,000 guerrillas swiftly captured many towns and strategic positions northwest of the capital and cut key communications lines between the capital and the hinterland.  In the meantime, they also attacked some 50 government army bases and police stations in the hinterland, thus controlling 30 percent of the country's territory.  They have established \"local people's governments\" in 8 of the 14 provinces throughout the country.  During this period, the government dispatched armored cars and air force units to carry out counterattacks.  They wantonly bombarded the residential areas near the capital city occupied by the guerrillas.  After 8 days of fierce battle, the guerrillas shot down 12 government fighter planes and helicopters; destroyed 34 tanks, armored cars, and patrol cars; and captured a large amount of arms and ammunition.  Subsequently battles continued in regions outside the capital city.  Since early December both sides have engaged in fierce battles in the capital city and the hinterland. The guerrillas used mortars to attack the building of the government army general staff headquarters, the U.S.  embassy, and the presidential restaurant, whereas the government army dispatched planes to bombard the guerrilla positions.  Fierce battles have also broken out in Chalatenango, San Miguel, and other towns, thereby causing heavy casualties and property losses.",
        " This war has deep-rooted causes.  El Salvador is a small country with an area of 21,000 square km and a population of 5 million. During this 10-year-long war, 70,000 people have died and the national economy has been seriously destroyed.  The ultrarightist nationalist republican alliance [Arena] Won the general election early this year, thus aggravating the conflict between the guerrillas and the government.  Prior to the election, the guerrillas put forward a peace proposal demanding six months' posponement of the election so as to make their participation possible.  But this proposal was rejected by the government.  Because almost half of the voters did not vote, the guerrillas declared it did not recognize the Cristiani government. Pressed by domestic public opinion and urged by the Central american peace agreement, the government and the guerrillas held two rounds of talks in September and October.  During their talks the guerrillas demanded that the government stop its suppression, introduce political, economic, and judicial reforms, reorganize the armed forces, and punish the \"dare-to-die squad.\"  The government insisted that the guerrillas should lay down their arms before reforms were carried out.  The hard-line position of the government reflected the established policy of the ruling party, which has all along stood for ruling the country by military means, advocated the suppression of democratic forces, and supported the \"dare-to-die squad\" in carrying out assassination.  A university president in Central America was assassinated by the squad for criticizing the ultrarightist policy of the ruling party.  Recently the ruling party supported the \"dare-to-die squad\" in attacking the labor federation's building. This ignited the current civil war and undermined the peace process in the country. The guerrillas issued a statement on 12 December condemning the meeting of the five heads of state for being partial to the ultrarightist salvadorian government.  They made it clear that they would not accept any effort to dissolve the guerrilla forces and would carry on their struggle.  [Continued]",

        " In the face of domestic and international pressure, and the comdemnation of the brutal murder of the social democratic leaders, president Cerezo decided to establish an investigative commission to which he plans to add a representative of an international organization.  On 23 January the socialist delegate who is in the country (without naming it) clearly referred to a legally registered guatemalan political party, which enjoys full political rights, as the \"nanny\" party of the nationalist republican alliance, Arena, of El Salvador.  He is levelling serious charges, which could even create legal and political conflicts between Guatemala and El Salvador, by insisting that the crime was politically motivated, which seems to be evident, and by linking the crime to political parties of the two countries.  With the due respect that the presidential commission deserves, the supreme court of justice should be consulted about what should be done next because the case is under the purview of guatemalan courts, especially those in Jutiapa jurisdiction.  Those courts should be the ones tasked with collecting the evidence, issuing the summons, and making the necessary statements.  Anything else constitutes interfering with justice.

On 31 October, an ultrarightist \"dare-to-die squad\" supported by the government and the military used a heavy bomb to bombard the headquarters building of the labor federation, killing and wounding over 40 people including principal leaders of the federation.  On 2 November, the guerrillas issued a statement strongly condemning the terrorist activity of the squad and declaring the cancellation of the third round of talks with the government scheduled in Venezuela.  On the same night the guerrillas launched a large-scale offensive \"to eliminate fascism.\"  About 8,000 guerrillas swiftly captured many towns and strategic positions northwest of the capital and cut key communications lines between the capital and the hinterland.  In the meantime, they also attacked some 50 government army bases and police stations in the hinterland, thus controlling 30 percent of the country's territory.  They have established \"local people's governments\" in 8 of the 14 provinces throughout the country.  During this period, the government dispatched armored cars and air force units to carry out counterattacks.  They wantonly bombarded the residential areas near the capital city occupied by the guerrillas.  After 8 days of fierce battle, the guerrillas shot down 12 government fighter planes and helicopters; destroyed 34 tanks, armored cars, and patrol cars; and captured a large amount of arms and ammunition.  Subsequently battles continued in regions outside the capital city.  Since early December both sides have engaged in fierce battles in the capital city and the hinterland. The guerrillas used mortars to attack the building of the government army general staff headquarters, the U.S.  embassy, and the presidential restaurant, whereas the government army dispatched planes to bombard the guerrilla positions.  Fierce battles have also broken out in Chalatenango, San Miguel, and other towns, thereby causing heavy casualties and property losses.",

The armed forces of a country should respond to the democratic process and to the government that is legitimately elected by the people.
