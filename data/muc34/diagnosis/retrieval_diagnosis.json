On 31 October, an ultrarightist \"dare-to-die squad\" supported by the government and the military used a heavy bomb to bombard the headquarters building of the labor federation, killing and wounding over 40 people including principal leaders of the federation.  On 2 November, the guerrillas issued a statement strongly condemning the terrorist activity of the squad and declaring the cancellation of the third round of talks with the government scheduled in Venezuela.  On the same night the guerrillas launched a large-scale offensive \"to eliminate fascism.\"  About 8,000 guerrillas swiftly captured many towns and strategic positions northwest of the capital and cut key communications lines between the capital and the hinterland.  In the meantime, they also attacked some 50 government army bases and police stations in the hinterland, thus controlling 30 percent of the country's territory.  They have established \"local people's governments\" in 8 of the 14 provinces throughout the country.  During this period, the government dispatched armored cars and air force units to carry out counterattacks.  They wantonly bombarded the residential areas near the capital city occupied by the guerrillas.  After 8 days of fierce battle, the guerrillas shot down 12 government fighter planes and helicopters; destroyed 34 tanks, armored cars, and patrol cars; and captured a large amount of arms and ammunition.

Peru has been the target of bloody terrorist attacks.  There can be no concessions for terrorists other than those granted by the law.  This fact cannot be dispelled by an anecdote like the one I read in the newspapers today.  The essential fact is that this arrest [Of Victor polay Campos] Is a major blow to subversion.

I am a bit concerned over what I have heard on this radio station.  The truth is that at approximately 0030 today, there was an attack with a homemade bomb in La Ceiba, and, as a result, seven U.S.  soldiers -- not six -- were wounded.  Four sustained very minor injuries, while three were somewhat seriously wounded, but they are not in danger of dying.  Nine soldiers were in that group.  They were not on leave; they were on a mission from the Enrique Soto Cano honduran air base at Palmerola.",

We captured two suspects.  Our men were about 100 meters away when the attack occurred, and, unfortunately, the two suspects are U.S.  citizens.  In other words, people were in the area and no one knew what they were doing.  This is an official report; this is what took place in La Ceiba.  The two suspects were arrested, and they must know something about the seven who were wounded, who are at the [Word indistinct] Hospital.  What you reported over the radio is correct.  There is no need to be alarmed.  It was a homemade bomb, and the damage was caused by the shrapnel, cement, and stones that were thrown into the air by the explosion.",

When it gets dark, we will proceed to ask for identification papers; we will stop and check vehicles, which is normal in this type of situation.  However, at no time will we paralyze production or normal daily activities.  We are trying to find the culprits responsible for this attack.  Regardless of whether it was an attack against U.S.  citizens, it was certainly an attack against peace and order.  We therefore have to investigate it, regardless of whether or not it involved U.S.  citizens.  In this case, and in view of this situation, I personally issued orders and followed the investigation until 0500, when I suspended all operations.  I personally ordered these measures.  I am amazed that the cattlemen do not transport milk before 0500.",

        " [Zamora] Negotiations are becoming increasingly necessary.  The guerrilla offensive shows that the fmln is a strong military force, but also that a revolutionary attitude does not exist among the masses.  It also shows that the government army, after 10 years of U.S. training, is an army whose military stance is defensive, not offensive (which is the key to U.S. military strategy.)  while this all shows that there can only be a negotiated solution to the crisis, it is also true that precisely following the guerrilla offensive (and this is the paradox) the army stiffened its stance against negotiations.  I believe that sooner or later common sense will prevail and it will sit down at the negotiating table.  At the end of November the U.S. secretary of state's assistant for Latin America spoke officially for the first time about the need for negotiations to resolve the crisis in El Salvador: this is an important sign of a changing situation.",

In our view, col Benavides was implicated solely as a means of propaganda aimed at the U.S. congress.  It is clear that col Benavides did not give the order.  He probably did not even know about the action.  This is consistent with what we know about his background.  First, he is not known to have carried out acts of repression or corruption.

About 15 days ago, I heard the news that the salvadoran government, the salvadoran army, was bombing neighborhoods and cities in El Salvador, that it was murdering the salvadoran people.  I later heard that the salvadoran army had murdered six jesuit priests, among them a priest who had been dean of the Catholic University here in Nicaragua.  It was then that I began to think and asked myself: how can I welcome the president of El Salvador here in Nicaragua when the Central american summit is held?  what a problem.  A real problem.  How could I welcome in Nicaragua the representative of a government that kills priests and bishops, that killed Monsignor Romero; a government that kills clergymen, that has killed nuns and members of other churches, catholics and evangelists; a government that kills workers, peasants, laborers, and leaders of political parties, that has killed more than 600 Christian democratic party leaders.  They were killed by Arena [Nationalist republic alliance], the ruling party in El Salvador, and the salvadoran army, which is the same thing.  I kept asking myself: how can I welcome them in Nicaragua?  it would be like welcoming somoza.  All I could come up with was to find an excuse not to hold the meeting.  It would have been terrible for the nicaraguan people to have to welcome and have as a guest the representative of a government that kills priests, nuns, workers, laborers, peasants, intellectuals, professionals, and workers.  Therefore, this news made me happy.  It made me happy because we have avoided the problem of having to welcome, in Nicaragua, the president of that government of international killers and common criminals.  [Applause]",

The ultrarightist nationalist republican alliance [Arena] Won the general election early this year, thus aggravating the conflict between the guerrillas and the government.  Prior to the election, the guerrillas put forward a peace proposal demanding six months' posponement of the election so as to make their participation possible.  But this proposal was rejected by the government.  Because almost half of the voters did not vote, the guerrillas declared it did not recognize the Cristiani government. Pressed by domestic public opinion and urged by the Central american peace agreement, the government and the guerrillas held two rounds of talks in September and October.  During their talks the guerrillas demanded that the government stop its suppression, introduce political, economic, and judicial reforms, reorganize the armed forces, and punish the \"dare-to-die squad.\"  The government insisted that the guerrillas should lay down their arms before reforms were carried out.  The hard-line position of the government reflected the established policy of the ruling party, which has all along stood for ruling the country by military means, advocated the suppression of democratic forces, and supported the \"dare-to-die squad\" in carrying out assassination.  A university president in Central America was assassinated by the squad for criticizing the ultrarightist policy of the ruling party.  Recently the ruling party supported the \"dare-to-die squad\" in attacking the labor federation's building. This ignited the current civil war and undermined the peace process in the country. The guerrillas issued a statement on 12 December condemning the meeting of the five heads of state for being partial to the ultrarightist salvadorian government.  They made it clear that they would not accept any effort to dissolve the guerrilla forces and would carry on their struggle.  [Continued]",

On 23 January the socialist delegate who is in the country (without naming it) clearly referred to a legally registered guatemalan political party, which enjoys full political rights, as the \"nanny\" party of the nationalist republican alliance, Arena, of El Salvador.  He is levelling serious charges, which could even create legal and political conflicts between Guatemala and El Salvador, by insisting that the crime was politically motivated, which seems to be evident, and by linking the crime to political parties of the two countries.  With the due respect that the presidential commission deserves, the supreme court of justice should be consulted about what should be done next because the case is under the purview of guatemalan courts, especially those in Jutiapa jurisdiction.  Those courts should be the ones tasked with collecting the evidence, issuing the summons, and making the necessary statements.  Anything else constitutes interfering with justice.
